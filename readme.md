# JavaScript Racer

## Introduction

Let's start out with something fun - a game!

We are going to implement a "racer game" using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you as you get started.


## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Make a racer game that two players can play (on one keyboard) by each pressing a key to move their player across the board
- When one player gets their player to the other side, the game is over
- Display the winner of the race!
- Use only vanilla JavaScript. No jQuery!

**Bonus:**
- Some extra ideas for medium/advanced students
- Use images to create a fun background and players
- Score each game based on the time it took to complete and by how much time they beat the opposing player
- Display the time it took for the player to complete the race
- Make a 'Best of 3' tournament, and display the winner of the tournament
- Keep track of best times/ high scores across page refreshes using localStorage
- Add animations
- Have players do something other than simply pressing a key to move their player, for example, make them type words, or solve simple math problems

#### Starter code

There is no starter code for this project other than one blank HTML, CSS, and JS files located in the code folder of this repo. Here are some tips on how to get started:
- Start simple! Ask yourself what the MVP of this project is
- Create HTML and CSS files that create one red square div and one blue, lined up on the left side of the screen
- Add a keydown event listener that console logs "blue move" or "red move"
- replace that console log with JavaScript that moves the red or blue div a little to the right
- Run with it from there!
- If you are stuck on a problem, use pseudo-coding to break it down into smaller, more solvable problems

#### Deliverable

Fork this repository, and write your code in the existing files in the code directory of this repo. We will evaluate your by looking at each of your forks.

Here's a screenshot of what this could look like:
